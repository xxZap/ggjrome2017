## Explanation
"Un sacc de BOT (a lot of bots and kicks)" is a multiplayer arcade shooter settled in an arena where players fight to kill each other in bolt-thirsty matches. Player get and lose points accordingly to player kills. Additionally, some NPCs are automatically spawned at random times, accordingly to the mic noise: the more the environmental noise, the more are spawned! Each player fires shockwaves of 3 different colours. Each wave kills other players and the NPCs of the same colour. Shockwaves of the same colour from different players destroy reciprocally. Be careful: when the time is almost over will be time to run away quickly!!!
